QuickWeather is really fast. Just open the app and see the weather right now. There's no loading screen and no wait time. The weather is delivered to you with no extra junk, just clean and clear information.

You can add as many locations to the side drawer as you want to have their weather a single tap away. QuickWeather can even determine your current location if you allow it (location information is not collected).

QuickWeather is Always Free (No IAPs or Ads) and Always Open Source
